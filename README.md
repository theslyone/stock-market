## About Stock Market
Stock Market is a demo application scaffolded from the MEAN.JS full-stack JavaScript open-source solution, which provides a solid starting point for [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) based applications.

This repo is based on the [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/chart-the-stock-market) courseware.

## Usage
* Grunt - You're going to use the [Grunt Task Runner](http://gruntjs.com/) to automate your development process. Make sure you've installed Node.js and npm first, then install grunt globally using npm:

```bash
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
```
After this, just cd into the directory, npm install to download dependencies and grunt to run.
